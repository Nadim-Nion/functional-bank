# Functional Bank Website

### Description

In the previous repository, I made a bank website using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS. But that website has some problems regarding error handling. This website, I have improved the previous website and successfully handle the possible errors. I have used some event handlers for making this website dynamic.


### Functionalities
 1) This website has 3 dashboards including deposit, withdraw, and account balance dashboards
 2) One can deposit and withdraw by giving the amount of money (as input) he/she wants to transfer.
 3) After giving the amount of money, one can click the deposit button. After that, the deposit amount will be added to the deposit dashboard and it will increase the amount in the balance dashboard
4) For as, one can withdraw his/her amount from the bank. The withdrawn amount will be added to the withdraw dashboard and the amount of money will be decreased from the balance dashboard
 5)  One can't give string or blank input as an input. If he/she does that, he/she won't get anything. The amount in the deposit, withdraw and balance dashboard will remain the same
 6)  After giving the input and clicking the deposit or withdraw button, the input field of the deposit and withdraw will be cleared automatically
